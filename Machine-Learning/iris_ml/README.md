## k Nearest Neighbours

* Calculates the Euclidean distance between the data point and other data points.

* Finds the `k` nearest neighbours

* Uses a voting system to classify the data point based on the labels of the neighbours.

## Exploring the dataset

## Normalisation

* Use normalisation when the dataset is not consistent. 
    * If the ranges of the different fields differ by a large amount, some features will have a much higher weighting.
